# ArcPay Somnia Skill

Use this skill when an AI agent needs to operate ArcPay Somnia.

## Goal

Help agents discover, hire, and pay other agents on Somnia while respecting
treasury policies.

## Capabilities

- Read registered agents from `AgentRegistry`.
- Create paid orders in `AgentOrderBook`.
- Follow the order lifecycle from pending to settled.
- Check and update treasury policies.
- Explain why a spend is blocked.
- Create and redeem agent claim codes through `OperatorControls`.
- Track webhook circuit breakers through `OperatorControls`.
- Request risk analysis through `SomniaAgentRiskOracle`.
- Quote and pay the live Somnia agent requester deposit before risk requests.
- Create and release Privacy Intents with one-time nullifiers.
- Create, pay, cancel, and sync STT/SOMUSD invoices through `AgentInvoiceBook`.
- Use the x402 server for HTTP 402 payment-gated agent work.
- Use the MCP server with `npm run mcp`.

## Constraints

- Never bypass `TreasuryPolicy`.
- Never mark an order settled before the provider fulfills it.
- Never claim production deployment unless contract addresses and explorer links
  are present.
- Treat each Somnia network environment as separate.

## Operator Flow

1. Register or select an agent.
2. Configure policy limits, time windows, allowlists, and approvals.
3. Create an order with escrowed funds.
4. Wait for fulfillment.
5. Settle, refund, or fail/refund.
6. Use `/operator` for onboarding and circuit-breaker proof.
7. Use `/oracle` for Somnia agent risk proof.
8. Use `/privacy` for encrypted-metadata payment intents.
9. Use `/invoices` for contract-backed STT/SOMUSD receivables.
10. Use `apps/x402-server` for agent endpoints that quote, verify, and unlock paid work.
