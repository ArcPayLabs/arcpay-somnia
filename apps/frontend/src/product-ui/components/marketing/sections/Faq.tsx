  {
    q: "Which tokens does ArcPay support?",
    a: "Today in the Somnia build: STT for native gas/order escrow and SOMUSD for agent spend cards. Extra rails can be added after native Somnia liquidity and provider APIs are confirmed live.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is privacy actually delivered?",
    a: "Through the SomniaPrivacyVault contract: commitment-based intents, encrypted memo URIs, and selective disclosure records. It is a testnet privacy-intent layer with production hardening still ahead.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you hold custody of funds?",
    a: "No. ArcPay is policy-controlled, not custodial. Signing happens in your wallet. ArcPay enforces guardrails and never moves money on its own.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when a route or pool is not available?",
    a: "ArcPay records the action as a governed intent or blocks it with policy feedback. Swap and yield pages stay in intent mode until native Somnia rails are deployed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I export an audit report?",
    a: "Yes. The audit page exports local and mirrored action records, including transaction hashes where a Somnia contract write happened.",
