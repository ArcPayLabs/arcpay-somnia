ArcPay supports wallet-first operator access and hosted MCP developer keys.

## Human operators

1. Open https://arcpay-somnia.vercel.app/sign-in
2. Connect an EVM wallet on Somnia Testnet or use an existing email workspace.
3. Create or resume a workspace before opening the dashboard.

## Agent and MCP clients

Agent registration is supported through ArcPay workspace onboarding, scoped MCP developer keys, and claim-code based agent onboarding.

### Agent registration

ArcPay supports the auth.md agent registration pattern for agent onboarding.

Supported flows:

- Agent verified flow: 'identity_assertion' with 'urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag'.
- User claimed flow: 'anonymous' pre-claim registration followed by claim-code or workspace ownership.

Endpoints:

- register_uri: https://arcpay-somnia.vercel.app/agent/auth
- claim_uri: https://arcpay-somnia.vercel.app/agent/auth/claim
- claim_complete_uri: https://arcpay-somnia.vercel.app/agent/auth/claim/complete
- revocation_uri: https://arcpay-somnia.vercel.app/agent/auth/revoke
- Protected Resource Metadata: https://arcpay-somnia.vercel.app/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource

Supported identity and credential types:

  "assertion_types_supported": [
    "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag",
    "verified_email"
